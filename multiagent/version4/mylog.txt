Question 1
As mentioned in the lectures, the Canadian Copyright Act normally confers on your Employer only the copyright in creations that you make as part of your job. It does not extend to creations that you make outside of your job. Thus, by default, you hold a copyright on any creation that you make outside of work, on your own time and using your own resources. That said, when you sign an employment contract, you might be agreeing to assign to your Employer the IP rights to all creations that you make inside and outside of your job. If so, this contract supersedes the Canadian Copyright Act.

Part i. Provide a concrete example of a hypothetical product or creation you might make as a side project outside of the course of work (e.g., at home at night). If you are currently working outside of Canada, assume that you are working in Canada for this assignment. Provide enough details so that you can refer back to this example as you're answering the next set of questions below. What resources (e.g. time, equipment) are you using in your side project?‚Äù

Part ii. Explain what bearing each of the following would have on whether you or your Employer would have IP rights on this product or creation:

The Canadian Copyright Act, Section 13 (other sections are not directly applicable; see Unit 2 Key Terms for definitions).
Your current employment contract, or this Partial Employment Contract.
Your job description, the nature of your work for your Employer, and the current business interests of your Employer. If you are not currently employed, assume that your job responsibilities are related to your example product, and your example product falls within the realm of the business interests of that company.

**Question 1: Professional Responsibility in Computing**

**Part i: Hypothetical Creation Example**
For my side project, I am developing a mobile application called "EcoTrack," which helps users monitor their carbon footprint by tracking daily activities such as transportation, energy consumption, and waste management. I am working on this project during my evenings and weekends, using my personal laptop and smartphone. The resources I am utilizing include programming software (such as Android Studio), graphic design tools (like Adobe Illustrator), and online tutorials to enhance my coding skills. This project is entirely independent of my employment and is being developed outside of my work hours.

**Part ii: IP Rights Considerations**
1. **The Canadian Copyright Act, Section 13**: According to this section, the copyright in a work created by an employee in the course of their employment typically belongs to the employer. However, since "EcoTrack" is developed outside of my job responsibilities and on my own time, I retain the copyright for this creation, as it does not fall under the employer's purview.

2. **Current Employment Contract**: If my employment contract includes a clause that assigns IP rights to my employer for all creations, regardless of when or where they are made, this could potentially affect my rights to "EcoTrack." If such a clause exists, it would supersede the default protections of the Canadian Copyright Act, meaning my employer could claim rights to the application.

3. **Job Description and Employer's Business Interests**: My job description involves software development for a different type of application, and my employer's current business interests do not include environmental tracking or sustainability apps. Therefore, even if my employment contract does not explicitly assign IP rights, the nature of my work and the unrelated business interests of my employer further support my claim to the copyright of "EcoTrack."

Draft response for Question 1 of Professional Development Course Assignment:
**Question 1: Professional Responsibility in Computing**

**Part i: Hypothetical Creation Example**  
For my side project, I am developing a mobile application called "EcoTrack," designed to help users monitor their carbon footprint by tracking daily activities such as transportation, energy consumption, and waste management. This application aims to raise awareness about environmental impact and promote sustainable practices among users. I am working on this project during my evenings and weekends, utilizing my personal laptop and smartphone for development. The resources I am employing include programming software like Android Studio for coding, graphic design tools such as Adobe Illustrator for creating user interfaces, and various online tutorials to enhance my programming skills. This project is entirely independent of my employment and is being developed outside of my work hours.

**Part ii: IP Rights Considerations**  
1. **The Canadian Copyright Act, Section 13**: According to this section, the copyright in a work created by an employee in the course of their employment typically belongs to the employer. However, since "EcoTrack" is developed outside of my job responsibilities and on my own time, I retain the copyright for this creation, as it does not fall under the employer's purview.

2. **Current Employment Contract**: If my employment contract includes a clause that assigns IP rights to my employer for all creations, regardless of when or where they are made, this could potentially affect my rights to "EcoTrack." If such a clause exists, it would supersede the default protections of the Canadian Copyright Act, meaning my employer could claim rights to the application.

3. **Job Description and Employer's Business Interests**: My job description involves software development for applications unrelated to environmental tracking, and my employer's current business interests do not include sustainability apps. Therefore, even if my employment contract does not explicitly assign IP rights, the nature of my work and the unrelated business interests of my employer further support my claim to the copyright of "EcoTrack." 

In summary, while the Canadian Copyright Act provides a baseline for copyright ownership, the specifics of my employment contract and the nature of my work play crucial roles in determining the IP rights associated with my side project. Since "EcoTrack" is developed outside of work hours and responsibilities, the copyright remains with me as the creator.
