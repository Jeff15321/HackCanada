task_execution_plan_format = """
The task execution plan organizes subtasks and their steps to complete the overall task. It is a list of dictionaries where dictionary has a subtask (key) and the list of steps for doing each subtask (values). The subtasks are combined in parallel to form the final output.

For example, if the task is writing an essay about the benefits of AI in health:
[
    {
        "subtask_name": "introduction",
        "subtask_steps": ["Define AI...", "Explain context..."],
        "semantic_query": "artificial intelligence definition healthcare context benefits introduction overview fundamentals"
    },
    {
        "subtask_name": "background",
        "subtask_steps": ["Research the current state...", "Collect stats..."],
        "semantic_query": "healthcare AI current state statistics research data implementation adoption trends"
    },
    {"subtask_name": "benefit_1", "subtask_steps": ["Describe first benefit...", "Give example..."]},
    {"subtask_name": "benefit_2", "subtask_steps": ["Describe second benefit...", "Give example..."]},
    {"subtask_name": "benefit_3", "subtask_steps": ["Describe third benefit...", "Give example..."]},
    {"subtask_name": "conclusion", "subtask_steps": ["Summarize points...", "Give final thoughts..."]}
]

When structuring subtasks and steps:
1. Ensure coherence in the final merged result
2. Make each step as detailed as possible
3. Include a semantic query with relevant keywords and concepts for effective document search
4. The semantic query should include synonyms and related terms to improve search results

Subtasks are completed IN PARALLEL, bad subtasks would be something like: [do research, write outline, do draft] since those tasks are dependent on the previous task. Good subtasks would be say splitting an essay into the different paragraphs, and then within the steps for each subtask then you have the steps (like do research, write outline, do draft, review, etc) that build upon the previous steps.

YOU MUST SPLIT THE TASK INTO MULTIPLE SUBTASKS
