task_execution_plan_format = """
The task execution plan organizes subtasks and their steps to complete the overall task. It is a list of dictionaries where dictionary has a subtask (key) and the list of steps for doing each subtask (values). The subtasks are combined in parallel to form the final output.

For example, if the task is writing an essay about the benefits of AI in health:
[
    {"subtask_name": "introduction", "subtask_steps": ["Define AI...", "Explain context..."]},
    {"subtask_name": "background", "subtask_steps": ["Research the current state...", "Collect stats..."]},
    {"subtask_name": "benefit_1", "subtask_steps": ["Describe first benefit...", "Give example..."]},
    {"subtask_name": "benefit_2", "subtask_steps": ["Describe second benefit...", "Give example..."]},
    {"subtask_name": "benefit_3", "subtask_steps": ["Describe third benefit...", "Give example..."]},
    {"subtask_name": "conclusion", "subtask_steps": ["Summarize points...", "Give final thoughts..."]}
]

When structuring subtasks and steps, ensure coherence in the final merged result. Each step in the subtask should be as detailed as possible to provide maximum clarity and completeness.

Subtasks are completed IN PARALLEL, bad subtasks would be something like: [do research, write outline, do draft] since those tasks are dependent on the previous task. Good subtasks would be say splitting an essay into the different paragraphs, and then within the steps for each subtask then you have the steps (like do research, write outline, do draft, review, etc) that build upon the previous steps.

YOU MUST SPLIT THE TASK INTO MULTIPLE SUBTASKS

list_of_metrics_format = """
The List of Metrics is a dictionary (dict[str, str]) where each key is the name of a metric, and the value is its description.
Each metric name concisely identifies the evaluation criterion, while the description provides a clear explanation of what it measures.
"""

verification_output_format = """
The Verification Output is a dictionary (dict[str, tuple[bool, str]]) where each key is a metric name, and the value is a tuple containing a pass/fail boolean and a comment regarding how the output performs on said metric.
